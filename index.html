            I stumble through my existence,
            Faces of the past now lost in the mists,
            No longer comprehending the distance.

            Yet still, all seems like a dream,
            The information swirling in my mind,
            Leaving me lost and unsure, it seems.

            A static figure in a world of change,
            As silence breaks and tsunamis pass,
            I grow and evolve, but still, I feel the same.

            As I move forward on my path,
            But their memory lingers, haunting my days,
            Reminding me of the past I cannot grasp.

            But I will forge my own way,
            And leave the past behind.</h3>
