            I stumble through my existence,<br>
            Faces of the past now lost in the mists,<br>
            No longer comprehending the distance.

            Yet still, all seems like a dream,<br>
            The information swirling in my mind,<br>
            Leaving me lost and unsure, it seems.

            A static figure in a world of change,<br>
            As silence breaks and tsunamis pass,<br>
            I grow and evolve, but still, I feel the same.

            As I move forward on my path,<br>
            But their memory lingers, haunting my days,<br>
            Reminding me of the past I cannot grasp.

            Their paths, forever intertwined,<br>
            But I will forge my own way,<br>
            And leave the past behind.</h3>
